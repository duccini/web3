Essentially, Solidity does not support floating point numbers - that is decimals. Also, since ERC20 tokens
 deal with money, using floating point numbers is a bad idea.

As an example, consider the simple calculation (1/3) * 3 in a language that supports floating point 
numbers. What do you think this returns?

If you thought it would return 1, you are wrong.

Due to inaccuracies in floating point calculations, since computers cannot represent an infinite number 
of digits, (1/3) * 3 actually yields something like 0.999999999.

As such, when representing financial currencies, decimals are not used due to calculation errors. As an 
alternative, we represent every currency as an amount relative to the smallest indivisible part of that 
currency. For example, $1 is represented as 100 cents, since you can't get smaller than 1 cent when 
dealing with USD. In that numbering system, 1 cent is just 1, not 0.01. $0.33 is represented as 33, 
not (1/3).
